# Practical Object Oriented Design With Ruby (by Sandy Metz), in ECMASCript6

## Sample code from this excellent book translated to ES6.

This repo is an adaptation to ES6 of the samples of the book, chapter by chapter except 1, 4 and 5 are they illustrate concepts that don't need
to be translated in my humble opinion.

The book is available [here](http://www.sandimetz.com/products/) and I strongly recommend reading it as gives a great insight in OOP in a pragmatic way.

## How to run the code

You need to install node, and from Within the main folder, run 
```
npm install
```

After that, to run code from a chapter, 

```
babel-node ch02/Gear01.js
```

To run the tests in chapter 9, just

```
npm run test
```
